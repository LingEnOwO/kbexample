# If you want to run DB migrations using this container, you'll need the following changes:
# - Install atlas in the build container: RUN curl -sSf https://atlasgo.sh | sh -s -- -y
# - Copy the migrations folder (or schema.sql file) into the container: COPY migrations /migrations
# - Run the migrations before starting the app: CMD ["sh", "-c", "/atlas migrate apply --dir file://migrations --url $DATABASE_URL && /app"]
